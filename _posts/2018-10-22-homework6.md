### Loading Audio
One of the first challenges was even figuring out how to load all of the audio. If you go to the project's [audio folder](https://github.com/Huriphoonado/code-of-music/tree/master/projects/Sample/guitar). you'll notice there are over 100 samples of guitar notes to use. The title of each sample clearly defines its sound through 4 parameters - *pitch, octave, amplitude, type* where type is either 'normal' or 'harmonics'. This seems amazing, but one quickly notices that it is incomplete - all pitch classes are covered, but each pitch only has certain octaves, amplitudes, and types. This is a challenge both for loading it all, as ideally one would prefer to avoid manually typing the whole list, as well as playing since not all notes are available.

My first attempt at this was to use Javascript error catching to prevent default behavior. I quickly found that 404 errors don't count as errors worthy of breaking code and so my `Try Except` blocks did absolutely nothing. Then, puzzled, I tried loading the audio files, checking if they had successfully loaded by setting a variable to `true` and then adding the successes to an array. But, of course this is an asynchronous call so my code would move on before the variable would ever change to true. (This is usually a good thing because the user interface will still be fully functional even while data sources are loading.) Finally, I came up with a solution that uses a synchronous function (below) to check if the file even exists before attempting to load it. This solution worked, but had two limitations: First, it blocked the user interface at the beginning so there was noticeable lag after `setup()` got called. Second, no matter what it would print hundreds of errors to the console.

```javascript
function urlExists(url) {
    var http = new XMLHttpRequest();
    http.open('HEAD', url, false);
    http.send();
    return http.status!=404;
}
```

I slept on it and came up with a solution that solves both of those problems. It requires an extra step, but I think it is worth it.

### Implementation
For color, I wanted random colors, but I did not want total randomness nor did I want to predefine a set of colors. The solution I came up with is based on the [p5 Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). I found an image with a color palette I really liked and every time a button is pressed, a random point drawn from the image determines the color.

### Challenges
Another problem with this particular library is that the onsets of many of these nots is not at the beginning of the recording. For example, the A3 at forte note takes over a full second for the note to be heard. This is clearly problematic for creating anything rhythmic since the onset is totally predictable. It is also challenging for visualization - all audio files have some sort of noice which creates amplitude and affects visuals without making any proper sound we care about.

[One thing that led to frustrating bugs early on: Coming from Python, I did not realize that Javascript does not support named parameters!](https://medium.com/dailyjs/named-and-optional-arguments-in-javascript-using-es6-destructuring-292a683d5b4e)

### Ideas
* Well Timed Guitar Samples - Write an onset detection algorithm that backtracks to the start of each onset and creates a series of series of well-timed guitar samples. (Not too hard with the Python Music Information Retrieval Library Librosa).
* Mouse Wheel Input.
* It would be awesome if the user could hover over the window and read the values of the current pitch set to know what they are hearing.
